Beryl
=====

Intro
-----

A stupid simple learning management system.

This project exists for a number of reasons:

- I wanted to learn Go
- I wanted to practice fullstack development
- Educational software can always get better
- I used Canvas back in college and figured I couldn't possibly do it worse

Some goals:

- Be as simple to use as possible
- Be as simple internally as possible
- Keep JavaScript to a minimum
- Keep CSS and HTML seperated

Some non-goals:

- Make the fans spin on your laptop when you load the pages
- Take over a second to render the page after it has downloaded
- Ugh

Why the name?

Beryl is short for Berylium, the 4th element on the periodic table. It's just a
codename for now.
